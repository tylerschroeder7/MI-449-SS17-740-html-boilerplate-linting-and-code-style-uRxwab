    <p>
      Listen here man, I've been traveling all across the galaxy with this furball
      and I know a thing or two about how these Wookies are. Time after time we've
      had to halt travels or make a pit stop in a random system just so he could
      get rid of his calf cramps. You'd think that he'd be less injury prone but the
      guy can't seem to cut it out. To save us on time and credits I started studying
      up on how these creatures operate and got a feel for how to fix some of these
      problems myself. Some extra profit on the side would help just in case I
      accidentally lose somebody's shipment I promised them or need to keep making
      repairs on the hyperdrive for the falcon. I'm the best guy for the job. Would
      I lie to ya?
